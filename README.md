Distraction detox
 
## Problem Statement

In this digital era, the unhealthy lifestyle is not just about having bad eating habits or irregular routines and sleeping habits but it’s also about our responding habits to distractions, digital pop-ups, procrastination. This in the long run results in our being unproductive, stressed, and dull. Generally, humans especially, students cannot focus on what’s important due to the never-ending notifications, messages, etc., we cannot resist the instinct of curiosity to know the info that notification is triggering and hence we delay what’s important at our hands and regret later. According to the research, it is cognitive distortions that lead to academic procrastination and students tend to:

* Overestimate the deadlines
* Overestimate their motivation
* Underestimate their efforts that the activities require
* Stress in the eleventh hour

These problems seem to be unimportant, and we simply ignore but in fact they got a real impact on our lives, health, and future. 

## Project Description

My project Distraction-detox is an enthusiastic chatbot whose aim is to keep the user motivated and help him/her practice brain hacks to deal with procrastination, build healthy habits, learn complex topics effectively, reduce stress, and live happily. Brain hacks are activities that chatbot suggests to the user based on the principles of generative learning, social learning, contextual learning, relevant learning, and playable learning.
The bot can be personalized by using the active learning feature offered by Azure to study the behavioural patterns and routines of the user and motivate and suggest accordingly.
QnA maker and LUIS services are being used to make the complete conversational flow. The bot can help the user to understand his/her causes of distractions, procrastination, or incapability to strikethrough the pending jobs. Additionally, the bot is also trained to suggest some exercises to overcome such situations.  
* Future scope: 
            
    I'll like to add cognitive services offered by Azure to give a voice, vision, etc., to the bot. Distraction detox with such capabilities can help the user to play Protege and learn effectively and the vision capabilities can be used to train the bot to hunt for distracting elements in the workspace that the user can suspend during working hours.

## Primary Azure Technology

- QnA Maker 
- Azure App Service (to host the bot)
- Static Web App (to deploy the bot using the app service url)

## Other Azure Technology 

- LUIS
- GitHub Actions
- Text to Speech*
- Azure Cognitive Services* 

*Proposed or expected to be used in future.
